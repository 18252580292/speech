# speech

Speech is an open-source package to build end-to-end models for automatic
speech recognition. Sequence-to-sequence models with attention and
connectionist temporal classification are currently supported.

The goal of this software is to facilitate research in end-to-end models in
speech recognition. The models are implemented primarily in PyTorch.
