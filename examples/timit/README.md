The Timit Speech corpus must be purchased from the LDC to run these
experiments. The catalog number is LDC93S1.

The data is mapped from 61 to 48 phonemes for training. For final test set
evaluation the 48 phonemes are again mapped to 39. The phone mapping is the
standard recipe, the mape used here is taken from the Kaldi TIMIT recipe.
